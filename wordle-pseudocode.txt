Cases to cover:

* Finding a word in a given word list and randomly selecting it for the game.
* Check for the “word” in the word list set for that game every time a player guesses.
* Validating the input given by the user (on a command line version, for example),
  e.g. is it five letters, does it consist of actual alphabetical characters, etc.
* How closely does the input word match the chosen word for the game and how to hint
  to the user that they’re getting closer?
* Evaluating guesses, which also depends on (and tracks) how many guesses a player has left.
* Checking if the game is over and the player has exhausted their guesses.
